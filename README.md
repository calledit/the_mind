# The Mind
My own ponderings, on classifying parts of the mind and the world.

## Human perception
Humans have a brain that is feed with signals that encode information about the world. These signals are acumulated, processed and catagorized. This activity is what allows human perception to exist.

To deepen the understanding of this phenomena we need a framework that describe this activity. I here propose a framework that has 5 key descriptions which i think are helpfull.



| Layer              | Desription                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical universe  | As best desribed by the standard model                                             |
| Sensor input       | Electrical signals from sensors(ears, eyes, nose. etc) detecting light, sound,...  |
| Model worldview    | The model of the world as the unconscious mind sees it. Basically a latent space.  |
| Perciver           | The conscious perciver (you reading this for example)                              |
| World as presented | The word as the perciver sees it. Presented to the perciver as perceptions.        |



### Physical universe
The physical universe is to complex for the human mind to comprehend in its entirety. The best descripions we have of what it is and how it "looks" is the standard model. Which can describe interactions betwen a few paricles in super computers. But the physical universe consists of contless particles. In such numbers that it is completly unimaginable. I added quotes to looks, case it does not look like anything, things looking like anything is a property that comes from photons interacting with the eyes. While the physical universe contains photons, it does not emit them. So eyes cant see them. There are more arguments that can be made as to why it does not look like anything but i wont go in to it. It should be obvoius if you understand what i mean, if it is not ask me so i can gain knowlage about how i should improve this description.

### Sensor input
Parts of the physical universe arange in to sensors that detect input such as light, air vibrations, pressure, heat and so on. These sensors convert those phenomena to nerve signals. Signals that are sent in to the brain, where the signals are proccessed.

### Model worldview
The model worldview is a latent space that describes the features of the subjective world. This is where things like chairs, tables, emotions, humans, words makes it's first apperance. The model worldview is manufactured and shaped by evolutionary pressure and sensor input. But also by feedback generated from the actions and reactions of the conscious perciver. That feedback seams to be mediated by dopamin to a certain extent.

### Perciver
The self aware perciver, it percives things and it knows that it percives things. It belives it exists in something. What it actaully exist is in the model worldview.

### World as presented
This is what the perciver see, in a sense it is a slice/a small part of the model worldview. You see a table, you see a human and so on. This is what a naive mind will belive "reality" is.


The world as the human consciousness perceives it is a representation manufactured by fitting sensory input to the model worldview.
In psychology this fitting of sensory input is often talked about as top-down processing.


## Basic assumptions/definitions
1. ***Everything*** is a model. You are a model, the things you see with your perception are models that your unconscious uses to grasp the world, math is a model, numbers are models, contexts/perspectives/categories/groups/objects/systems are models, the air is a model, words are models... its models all the way up, and all the way down. 
2. Truth, is only valid within the model that it is defined in. See [Gödel's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems). (It is invalid to validate a system using the system itself.)
3. There are models which describe **all** models. Those types of models is in a sense the closest you can come to absolute truth. Parts of this list is a description of such a model. 
4. A model of a thing is a formula that defines/describes the things properties, and/or how it behaves. A model can be consistent(ie the model is consistent with itself) or inconsistent(it contradicts itself). All models have validity, validity is a property that describes how well the model models the thing it is modelling(basically how accurate the models is).

## Other things that tend to confuse people 
* The unconscious: processes in you and your body that you are not directly aware of.
* The collective unconscious: processes inside and outside of your body that you are not directly aware of. Parts of the collective unconscious is simply socital patterns.
* Process: Terminology describing patterns of things leading somewere.
* [Necessary causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#Necessary_and_sufficient_causes) are the only proper causes, they are the only types of causes that allows one to use deductive reasoning. "Sufficient causes" are useful when telling storys, but should not be mixed up with "necessary causes" when one is trying to come to valid conclusions about the nature of things.
* ***Representationalism***: Each of us live, not in the physical world, but in a simulation that uses models to represent parts of the physical world. A simulation that is being executed by the brain of a primate(Homo sapiens).
* Personality, is a low resolution model of how you tend to behave based on your previous behaviour. The most well established personality system is "big five". It is fairly intuitive when you learn it. (Personal opinion: Openness to experience is the most important factor when it comes to people being interesting.)
* Causal closure: in a causally closed system only things from inside the system can cause things to happen in the system. You can however map other causal systems on top of a causally closed system. So that the causal boundaries project down to the lower system. Causal closure is maintained and cause and effect is valid in both the top and lower causal system.
* True: One thing being in accordance with some other thing according to some model. Example: 1=1 is true according to the rules of math.
* Real: Things that can have causal effect on other things that are real.
* Reality: The state of all real things.
* Magic: Things that can **not** exist in reality, due to contradicting reality in some way.
* Illusions: Things that seam like one thing, but are another thing.
* Choice: The description of choice and its effects is a causal system layered on top of the seemingly causally closed physical world.
* Free will: If we can have free will or not depends on how one defines free will. If one defines it as something that requires magic, it can not exist. But we have choice and will, we use those words to describe our actions everyday. So the real type of will that we have and talk about everyday exists, and can not be magic. Ignoring the old term "will" and defining a new term "free will" with magic properties, then denying that the new term could exist cause it has magic properties, gives us no new insight in to what "will" is, more than that it is not magic, but we already knew that, that is what we started with.
* Math: only math that is implementable is valid, aka constructive math. When people start doing math with [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) contradictions start to appear.
* ADHD, is a tendency to have problems getting into and maintaining longer sessions of concentration, and a tendency to constantly be active and moving around and doing short-term satisfaction things. At one level seemingly caused by the mind constantly craving more stimulation or inversely the mind feeling bored/unsatisfied whenever new stimulation is not present.
* Mental illness is defined in the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) as certain behaviour. ie. Psychologists definitions of mental illness define nothing mental.
* The cause of mental illness as described on the inter human layer: not thinking "usefully" about how the world functions, and then behaving strange due to not thinking "usefully". Why a person is not thinking "usefully" can be described in various ways, sometimes explanations made in a different causal system is used, where one defines the cause with chemical imbalances in the brain, and sometimes explanations with personal trauma is used.
