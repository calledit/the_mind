# The Mind
My own ponderings, on classifying parts of the mind and the world.

## Human perception
Humans have a brain that is feed with signals that encode information about the world. These signals are accumulated, processed and categorised. This activity is what allows human perception to exist.

To deepen the understanding of this phenomena we need a framework that can describe this activity. I here propose a framework that has 6 key descriptions which i think are helpful.



| Layer                      | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical universe          | As best described by the standard model                                             |
| Sensor input               | Electrical signals from sensors(ears, eyes, nose. etc) detecting light, sound,...   |
| Perceptual space model     | The model of the world as the unconscious mind "sees" it. Basically a latent space. |
| Perceiver                  | The conscious perceiver (you the one reading this for example)                      |
| World as presented         | The word as the perceiver sees it. Presented to the perceiver as perceptions.       |
| Personal ontological model | Model of what the perceiver consciously believes the world is and how it works.     |



### Physical universe
The physical universe is to complex for the human mind to comprehend in its entirety. The best descriptions we have of what it is and how it "looks" is the standard model. Which can describe interactions between a few particles in super computers. But the physical universe consists of countless particles. In such numbers that it is completely unimaginable. I wrote quotes around "looks", cause the physical universe does not look like anything, things looking like anything is a property that comes from photons interacting with the eyes. While the physical universe contains photons, it does not emit them. So eyes cant see it.

### Sensor input
Parts of the physical universe arrange in to sensors that detect input. Input such as light, air vibrations, pressure, heat and so on. These sensors convert those phenomena to nerve signals. Signals that are sent in to the brain, where the signals are processed.

### Perceptual space model
The perceptual space model is a latent space that describes the features of a perceivers subjective world. This is where things like chairs, tables, emotions, humans, dog barks and words makes their first appearance. The perceptual space model is manufactured and shaped by evolutionary pressure and sensor input. But also by reinforcement generated from the actions and reactions of the conscious perceiver.
A high level example of the shaping of the perceptual space model can be given by describing the act of learning to read.
1. Initially a person only perceives text as a bunch of unidentifiable symbols, something like a piece of abstract art.
2. Then the formal rules for reading is given to the individual by some teacher, that is the names of each of the symbols (the letters) and the rules for combing them to generate words.
3. The individual integrates the rules in to their personal ontological model, and repeatedly applies the rules until reading becomes automatic and thus integrated in to the perceptual space model.
4. At this stage the perceiver no longer perceives abstract art, but percepts of words and sentences when sensory input coming from text is given.


### Perceiver
The self aware perceiver, it perceives things and it knows that it perceives things. It believes it exists in something. What it actually exist is in the Perceptual space model.

### World as presented
This is what the perceiver see and experience, in a sense it is a slice/a small part of the perceptual space model. You see a table, you see a human and so on. This is what a naive mind will describe as "reality".

### Personal ontological model
A model that represents what the perceiver consciously believes the world is and how it works. This is what the perceiver will describe when it is asked about how things in the world works. The ontological model is created by the perceiver as it observes data available in the "world as presented". It is a belief system. Joscha Bach calls this "unified world model".

## Binding this together
The world as the human consciousness perceives it is a representation manufactured by fitting sensory input to the perceptual space model.
In psychology this fitting of sensory input is often talked about as top-down processing. Human consciousness can learn and understand that the word "world" can also refer to different things. We can understand that the world is not like it seams. Knowing that the world one lives in is a different world compared to the world that other people live in does not make the perceptions from ones own "World as presented" go away. Perceptions are perceptions and they do not disappear when one stops believing in them.

A simulation of the "perceptual space model" is being computed in the brain, and the perceiver lives in that simulation. But the perceiver is not only being feed with information from that simulation. The perceiver is an entity being simulated in the simulation.

*The work on this framework is not done and more will follow... if you want to read more about similar things look up Joscha Bach.


## Basic assumptions/definitions for a sane mind
1. ***Everything*** is a model. You are a model, the things you see with your perception are models that your unconscious uses to grasp the world, math is a model, numbers are models, contexts/perspectives/categories/groups/objects/systems are models, the air is a model, words are models... its models all the way up, and all the way down. 
2. Truth, is only valid within the model that it is defined in. See [Gödel's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems). (It is invalid to validate a system using the system itself.)
3. There are models which describe **all** models. Those types of models is in a sense the closest you can come to absolute truth. Parts of this list is a description of such a model. 
4. A model of a thing is a formula that defines/describes the things properties, and/or how it behaves. A model can be consistent(ie the model is consistent with itself) or inconsistent(it contradicts itself). All models have validity, validity is a property that describes how well the model models the thing it is modelling(basically how accurate the models is).

## Other things that tend to confuse people 
* The unconscious: processes in you and your body that you are not directly aware of.
* The collective unconscious: processes inside and outside of your body that you are not directly aware of. Parts of the collective unconscious is simply societal patterns.
* Process: Terminology describing patterns of things leading somewhere.
* [Necessary causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#Necessary_and_sufficient_causes) are the only proper causes, they are the only types of causes that allows one to use deductive reasoning. "Sufficient causes" are useful when telling storys, but should not be mixed up with "necessary causes" when one is trying to come to valid conclusions about the nature of things.
* ***Representationalism***: Each of us live, not in the physical world, but in a simulation that uses models to represent parts of the physical world. A simulation that is being executed by the brain of a primate(Homo sapiens).
* Personality, is a low resolution model of how you tend to behave based on your previous behaviour. The most well established personality system is "BIG 5". But there are other such systems, like the MBTI. The MTBI is older and is less "rigorous" but the BIG 5 and MTBI has some overlap, mainly on the extraversion/introversion dimension which are very similar in both systems but there is also some overlap in the dimension BIG-5-oppenness and MTBI-intuition/sensation.
* Causal closure: in a causally closed system only things from inside the system can cause things to happen in the system. You can however map other causal systems on top of a causally closed system. So that the causal boundaries project down to the lower system. Causal closure is maintained and cause and effect is valid in both the top and lower causal system.
* True: One thing being in accordance with some other thing according to some model. Example: 1=1 is true according to the rules of math.
* Real: Things that can have causal effect on other things that are real.
* Reality: The state of all real things.
* Magic: Things that can **not** exist in reality, due to contradicting reality in some way.
* Illusions: Things that seam like one thing, but are another thing.
* Choice: The description of choice and its effects is a causal system layered on top of the seemingly causally closed physical world.
* Free will: If we can have free will or not depends on how one defines free will. If one defines it as something that requires magic, it can not exist. But we have choice and will, we use those words to describe our actions everyday. So the real type of will that we have and talk about everyday exists, and can not be magic. Ignoring the old term "will" and defining a new term "free will" with magic properties, then denying that the new term could exist cause it has magic properties, gives us no new insight in to what "will" is, more than that it is not magic, but we already knew that, that is what we started with.
* Math: only math that is implementable is valid, aka constructive math. When people start doing math with [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) contradictions start to appear.
* ADHD, is a tendency to have problems getting into and maintaining longer sessions of concentration, and a tendency to constantly be active and moving around and doing short-term satisfaction things. At one level seemingly caused by the mind constantly craving more stimulation or inversely the mind feeling bored/unsatisfied whenever new stimulation is not present.
* Mental illness is defined in the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) as certain behaviour. ie. Psychologists definitions of mental illness define nothing mental.
* The cause of mental illness as described on the inter human layer: not thinking "usefully" about how the world functions, and then behaving strange due to not thinking "usefully". Why a person is not thinking "usefully" can be described in various ways, sometimes explanations made in a different causal system is used, where one defines the cause with chemical imbalances in the brain, and sometimes explanations with personal trauma is used.
