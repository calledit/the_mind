# The Mind
My own ponderings, on classifying parts of the mind and the world.

## Human perception
Humans have a brain that is feed with signals that encode information about the world. These signals are accumulated, processed and categorised. This activity allows human perception to exist.

To deepen the understanding of this phenomena we need a framework that can describe this activity. I here propose a framework that has 6 key descriptions which i think are helpful.



| Layer                      | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical universe          | As best described by the standard model                                             |
| Sensor input               | Electrical signals from sensors(ears, eyes, nose. etc) detecting light, sound,...   |
| Perceptual world model     | The model of the world as the unconscious mind "sees" it. Basically a latent space. |
| Perceiver                  | The conscious perceiver (you the one reading this for example)                      |
| World as presented         | The world as the perceiver sees it. Presented to the perceiver as perceptions.       |
| Personal ontological model | Model of what the perceiver consciously believes the world is and how it works.     |



### Physical universe
The **physical universe** (or the logos with another terminology) is to complex for the human mind to comprehend in its entirety. The best descriptions we have of what it is and how it "looks" is the standard model. Which with our current technology can be used to simulate interactions between a few particles in super computers. But the **physical universe** consists of countless particles, in such numbers that it is completely unimaginable. Earlier in the text there is quotes around "looks", cause the **physical universe** does not look like anything, things looking like anything is a property that comes from photons interacting with the eyes. While the **physical universe** contains photons, it does not emit them. So eyes cant see the **physical universe**. It is a common thought pattern among some people to assert that the **physical universe** consists of matter or particles, this material model of the **physical universe** is invalid. Matter and particles are ways of describing the **physical universe** on a specific level, it is not what the what the **physical universe** is, what the **physical universe** is we can not know.

### Sensor input
Parts of the **physical universe** arrange in to sensors that detect input. Input such as light, air vibrations, pressure, heat and so on. These sensors convert those phenomena to nerve signals. Signals that are sent in to the brain, where the signals are processed.

### Perceptual world model
The **perceptual world model** is a model of a latent space that describes the features of a **perceivers** subjective world. This is where things like chairs, tables, emotions, humans, dog barks and words makes their first appearance. **The perceptual world model** is manufactured and shaped by evolutionary pressure that amongst other guide the brain to grow in to a certain structure and design sensors and as such determine the modalities that is included in to the **perceptual world model**. The **perceptual world model** is also shaped by **sensor input** and by reinforcement learning generated from the actions and reactions of the conscious **perceiver**.
Following is a example of the shaping of the perceptual world model in the context of learning to read.
1. Initially a **perciver** only perceives text as a bunch of unidentifiable symbols, something like a piece of abstract art.
2. Then the formal rules for reading is given to the individual by some teacher. The rules being: The names of each of the symbols (the letters) and the rules for combing them to generate words.
3. The individual integrates the rules in to their **personal ontological model**, and repeatedly applies the rules until reading becomes automatic and thus integrated in to the **perceptual world model**.
4. At this stage the **perceiver** no longer perceives abstract art when sensory input coming from text is given, but percepts of words and sentences.


### Perceiver
The self aware conscious **perceiver**, it perceives things and it knows that it perceives things. It believes it exists in something. What it actually exists in is the **perceptual world model**.

### World as presented
This is what the **perceiver** see and experience, in a sense it is a slice/a small part of the **perceptual world model**. You see a table, you see a human and so on. This is what a naive mind will describe as "reality".

### Personal ontological model
A model that represents what the **perceiver** consciously believes the world is and how it works. This is what the **perceiver** will describe when it is asked about how things in the world works. The ontological model is created by the **perceiver** as it observes data available in the **"world as presented"**. It is a belief system. [Joscha Bach calls this "unified world model" in one of his lectures.](https://youtu.be/QF50rQE39P4?t=5769)

## Binding this together
A simulation (technically a simulacrum) of the **perceptual world model** is being computed in the brain based on the **sensor inputs**. The perceiver lives in that simulation, but the **perceiver** is not only being feed with information from that simulation the **perceiver** is in a sense an entity being simulated in the simulation.
The world as the human consciousness perceives it is a representation manufactured by fitting **sensory input** to the **perceptual world model**. In psychology this fitting of **sensory input** is often talked about as top-down processing. 


*The work on this framework is not done and it is a work in progress... if you want to read more about similar things look up Joscha Bach.*


## Basic assumptions/definitions for proper understanding
1. ***Everything*** is a model. You are a model, the things you see with your perception are models that your unconscious uses to grasp the world, math is a model, numbers are models, contexts/perspectives/categories/groups/objects/systems are models, the air is a model, words are models... its models all the way up, and all the way down. 
2. Truth, is only valid within the model that it is defined in. See [Gödel's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems). (It is invalid to validate a system using the system itself.)
3. There are models which describe **all** models. Those types of models is in a sense the closest you can come to absolute truth. Parts of this list is a description of such a model. 
4. A model of a thing is a formula that defines/describes the things properties, and/or how it behaves. A model can be consistent(ie the model is consistent with itself) or inconsistent(it contradicts itself). All models have validity, validity is a property that describes how well the model models the thing it is modelling(basically how accurate the models is).

It follows from these points that everything that you can think of is a description. i.e. From our perspective everything is descriptions of things, not the things themself.

## Other things that tend to cause confusion
* The unconscious: processes in you and your body that you are not directly aware of.
* The collective unconscious: processes inside and outside of your body that you are not directly aware of. Parts of the collective unconscious is simply societal patterns.
* Process: Terminology describing patterns of things leading somewhere.
* Meaning: The purpose or a description of something (as described within some context)/(in relationship to some model).
* [Necessary causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#Necessary_and_sufficient_causes) are the only proper causes, they are the only types of causes that allows one to use deductive reasoning. "Sufficient causes" are useful when telling storys, but should not be mixed up with "necessary causes" when one is trying to come to valid conclusions about the nature of things.
* ***Representationalism***: Each of us live, not in the physical world, but in a simulation that uses models to represent parts of the physical world. A simulation that is being executed by the brain of a primate(Homo sapiens).
* Personality, is a low resolution model of how you tend to behave based on your previous behaviour. The most well established personality system is "BIG 5". But there are other such systems, like the MBTI. The MTBI is older and is less "rigorous" but the BIG 5 and MTBI has some overlap, mainly on the extraversion/introversion dimension which are very similar in both systems but there is also some overlap in the dimension BIG-5-oppenness and MTBI-intuition/sensation.
* Causal closure: in a causally closed system only things from inside the system can cause things to happen in the system. You can however map other causal systems on top of a causally closed system. So that the causal boundaries project down to the lower system. Causal closure is maintained and cause and effect is valid in both the top and lower causal system.
* True: One thing being in accordance with some other thing according to some model. Example: 1=1 is true according to the rules of math.
* Real: Things that can have causal effect on other things that are real.
* Reality: The state of all real things.
* Magic: Things that can **not** exist in reality, due to contradicting reality in some way.
* Illusions: Things that seam like one thing, but are another thing.
* Choice: The description of choice and its effects is a causal system layered on top of the seemingly causally closed physical world.
* Math: only math that is implementable is valid, aka constructive math. When people start doing math with [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) contradictions start to appear.
* ADHD, is a tendency to have problems getting into and maintaining longer sessions of concentration, and a tendency to constantly be active and moving around and doing short-term satisfaction things. At one level seemingly caused by the mind constantly craving more stimulation or inversely the mind feeling bored/unsatisfied whenever new stimulation is not present.
* Mental illness is defined in the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) as certain behaviour. ie. Psychologists definitions of mental illness define nothing mental.
* The cause of mental illness as described on the inter human layer: not thinking "usefully" about how the world functions, and then behaving strange due to not thinking "usefully". Why a person is not thinking "usefully" can be described in various ways, sometimes explanations made in a different causal system is used, where one defines the cause with chemical imbalances in the brain, and sometimes explanations with personal trauma is used.
* The ego(jungian term): (ie the self model) the model that the perciver percives it is. It is what the organism uses to represent itself. It is a higly compressed representation of what the organism is(where the organism is the jungian self). Due to the compressed nature of the represantation that makes up the ego, the ego is always inacurate to some degree. Having an ego that is stucturally similar(ie. it models the same or similar dimensions) as other peoples egos is very useful as it allows one to make accurate predictions of other peoples behavior. Due to the fact that people in society use their own perception of themself to undersand others. Having a ego that does not structuraly match up well with the self or other peoples ego is to the best of my understanding what underlies many of the behaviors that we call autism.
* Invalid questions: A question where the context is not described is an invalid question. Invalid questions can not be answered, the question must be reframed/recontextualized before an answer can be given. The process of reframing technically creates a new question and the original question is thus left unanswered.


### Free will:
    If we can have free will or not depends on how one defines free will. If one defines it as something that requires magic, it can not exist. If one defines it as something that does not require magic it can.
    "Choice" and "will" can be described as a casal system where the choices we make have causal effect on the world, as such the choices you make have an effect on the world, things in the world would look diffrent if you did not make the choices you made. One can then argue that you did not make the choice yourself, it was a chain of events that led to the choice that was not in your control. An argument that depends on a magic belif where the human that you are is separate from the world. But you are not simply human in this context, you are a choice maker, a decision proccess that evaluated concepts and models and made a wheighted decision. The choice maker is a part of the human and the human is a part of the world so in a sense you are equaly much the choice maker as you are the human as you are the world. Beliving that you do not have free will is beliving that the thing that you are is separate from the world, which you are not, you are the world looking at itself from a certain perspective. The world can not predict its own true future and as such its future is not determined from it's own perspective, it is in a sense free.



### Definitions of words
There are loots of specific words in this text and the words mean very specific things, if the contents of this text it to be presented it will be important to lay out proper definitions. Proper definitions are definition that does not break consistency with other defintions that are located in the same paradigm.
