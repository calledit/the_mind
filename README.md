# The Mind
My own ponderings, on classifying parts of the mind and the world.

## Basic assumptions/definitions
1. ***Everything*** is a model. You are a model, the things you see with your perception are models that your unconscious uses to grasp the world, math is a model, numbers are models, contexts/perspectives/categories/groups/objects/systems are models, the air is a model, words are models... its models all the way up, and all the way down. 
2. Truth, is only valid within the model that it is defined in. See [Gödel's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems). (It is invalid to validate a system using the system itself.)
3. There are models which describe **all** models. Those types of models is in a sense the closest you can come to absolute truth. Parts of this list is a description of such a model. 
4. A model of a thing is a formula that defines/describes the things properties, and/or how it behaves. A model can be consistent(ie the model is consistent with itself) or inconsistent(it contradicts itself). All models have validity, validity is a property that describes how well the model models the thing it is modelling(basically how accurate the models is).

## Other things that tend to confuse people 
* The unconscious: processes in you and your body that you are not directly aware of.
* The collective unconscious: processes inside and outside of your body that you are not directly aware of. Parts of the collective unconscious is simply socital patterns.
* Process: Terminology describing patterns of things leading somewere.
* [Necessary causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#Necessary_and_sufficient_causes) are the only proper causes, they are the only types of causes that allows one to use deductive reasoning. "Sufficient causes" are useful when telling storys, but should not be mixed up with "necessary causes" when one is trying to come to valid conclusions about the nature of things.
* ***Representationalism***: Each of us live, not in the physical world, but in a simulation that uses models to represent parts of the physical world. A simulation that is being executed by the brain of a primate(Homo sapiens).
* Personality, is a low resolution model of how you tend to behave based on your previous behaviour. The most well established personality system is "big five". It is fairly intuitive when you learn it. (Personal opinion: Openness to experience is the most important factor when it comes to people being interesting.)
* Causal closure: in a causally closed system only things from inside the system can cause things to happen in the system. You can however map other causal systems on top of a causally closed system. So that the causal boundaries project down to the lower system. Causal closure is maintained and cause and effect is valid in both the top and lower causal system.
* True: One thing being in accordance with some other thing according to some model. Example: 1=1 is true according to the rules of math.
* Real: Things that can have causal effect on other things that are real.
* Reality: The state of all real things.
* Magic: Things that can **not** exist in reality, due to contradicting reality in some way.
* Illusions: Things that seam like one thing, but are another thing.
* Choice: The description of choice and its effects is a causal system layered on top of the seemingly causally closed physical world.
* Free will: If we can have free will or not depends on how one defines free will. If one defines it as something that requires magic, it can not exist. But we have choice and will, we use those words to describe our actions everyday. So the real type of will that we have and talk about everyday exists, and can not be magic. Ignoring the old term "will" and defining a new term "free will" with magic properties, then denying that the new term could exist cause it has magic properties, gives us no new insight in to what "will" is, more than that it is not magic, but we already knew that, that is what we started with.
* Math: only math that is implementable is valid, aka constructive math. When people start doing math with [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) contradictions start to appear.
* ADHD, is a tendency to have problems getting into and maintaining longer sessions of concentration, and a tendency to constantly be active and moving around and doing short-term satisfaction things. At one level seemingly caused by the mind constantly craving more stimulation or inversely the mind feeling bored/unsatisfied whenever new stimulation is not present.
* Mental illness is defined in the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) as certain behaviour. ie. Psychologists definitions of mental illness define nothing mental.
* The cause of mental illness as described on the inter human layer: not thinking "usefully" about how the world functions, and then behaving strange due to not thinking "usefully". Why a person is not thinking "usefully" can be described in various ways, sometimes explanations made in a different causal system is used, where one defines the cause with chemical imbalances in the brain, and sometimes explanations with personal trauma is used.
